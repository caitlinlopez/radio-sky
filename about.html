<div class="w3-rest">The radio image of the entire sky located on the home page was produced by the Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA).</div>
<div class="title">What is the OVRO-LWA?</div>
<div class="w3-rest">The OVRO-LWA is a new low frequency radio telescope composed of 288 dipole antennas. These antennas detect radio waves with frequencies between 27 and 85 MHz, or equivalently wavelengths between 11 and 3.5 meters respectively. The OVRO-LWA has the ability to snap pictures of the entire radio sky at these frequencies.</div>
<div class="title">What is the radio sky page?</div>
<div class="w3-rest">The radio sky webpage was designed to allow visitors to explore important objects in the universe, visible to the OVRO-LWA. These objects are bright sources of radio emission including our own galaxy (the Milky Way), 10,000 year old supernova remnants, and distant active galactic nuclei. The image updates every hour providing a near real-time view of the radio sky.</div>
<div class="title">What are astronomers learning with the OVRO-LWA?</div>
<div class="w3-rest">The OVRO-LWA performs fast-cadence all-sky imaging for the detection of low frequency transients, such as coherent radio emission from exoplanets and compact object mergers. The OVRO-LWA is also being used to search for the faint signature of distant hydrogen gas from the dark ages and cosmic dawn of the universe, which will provide insight into how galaxies like our own Milky Way were born. Finally the array is studying space weather events and solar bursts, as well the Earth's ionosphere.

<div class="w3-rest">
-Bandpass: 27 to 85 MHz (11 to 3.5 meter wavelengths)</div>
<div class="w3-rest">
- Back End: the 512 input LEDA correlator</div>
<div class="w3-rest">
- Field of View: the entire visible hemisphere</div>
<div class="w3-rest">

<div class="title">
Where is the OVRO-LWA located?</div>
<div class="w3-rest">
The OVRO-LWA is located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) near Big Pine, California (a 3 hour drive north from Bakersfield).
